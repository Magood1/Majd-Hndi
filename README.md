## 🚀 About Me

I'm passionate about using artificial intelligence and backend systems to solve real-world problems, especially in the medical and healthcare sectors.

Over the past few years, I've built and deployed end-to-end systems for diagnosing diseases using deep learning, integrating those models into robust APIs using **FastAPI** and **Flask**. I enjoy turning data into decisions and models into solutions.

💡 I love:
- Designing secure backend architectures using JWT and session-based authentication.
- Applying machine learning to medical images and patient data.
- Exploring NLP problems like satire detection in news media.
- Learning fast, building quickly, and delivering impact.
